# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding about how many Pewlett-Hackard employees were eligible for retirement by name, title, and department. The deliverable was produced by querying the various company data bases to identify employees born between 1952 – 1955. The output will help the company better understand and prepare for a coming “gray wave” of retirements that could negatively impact their future profitability. 

The second part of the project was to identify Pewlett-Hackard employees born in 1965 that could serve as mentors for junior employees. The deliverable will help the company identify senior employees that could serve as mentors for a younger generation in order to transfer hard won knowledge and experience which will help the company retain the institutional knowledge it has built up since its early days. This will help Pewlett-Hackard remain profitable well into the future. 

## Results:

### There are four main takeaways from the analysis:

### Almost a third of the workforce is eligible for retirement. 
The biggest take away from the project is 30.13% of Pewlett-Hackard’s current employees are eligible for retirement. Accoring to its database, the company currently has 300,024 employees and there are 90,398 employees eligible for retirement. Such a massive loss of institutional knowledge will be difficult to mitigate in their near term. 

### Eligible for Retirement as Percenatage of Workfroce

### Senior Engineers comprise the largest number of potential retirees, but senior staff make up the largest percentage. 
The largest absolute number of Pewlett-Hackard  employees eligible for retirement are Senior Engineers at 29,414, but it is roughly in line with the overall percentage of Pewlett-Hackard retirement eligible employees at 30.09% (vs 30.13% overall). A slightly higher number of Senior Staff are eligible for retirement at 30.43%.

### Managers make up the smallest group of potential retirees. 
Only two managers are eligible for retirement comprising of only 8.33% of all Managers within Pewlett-Hackard. This could be explained if Managers are more junior in their career and/or many of managers retire earlier than other Pewlett-Hackard employees. This could indicate that technical staff (Engineers and Technique Leaders) have higher job satisfaction and experience less burnout than Managers which allows them to continue working well past their eligible retirement date.

### Eligible mentors are roughly evenly distributed along areas with the highest number of potential retirees. 
There are a total of 58,859 Pewlett-Hackard employees eligible for the mentorship program and their numbers are distributed roughly in line with departments where retirement eligible employees are currently working. Engineers make up the largest number of mentors at 14,258 and comprise 25.08% of the mentors.

## Summary:

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

The above question is really two questions, the answers to both are important to Pewlett-Hackard  Executives. The first question is easy to answer; how many employees are eligible for retirement?  The answer is 90,398 Pewlett Hackard employees are eligible for retirement. The second question is how long before this “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact is much more difficult to answer. If these employees’ current positions can be automated, offshored, or made redundant, then the answer to the second question is a simple, “it won’t” or even “the impact will be positive”. If these positions are critical to be backfilled and the experience leaving will need to be replaced by several new and more junior employees then, the answer to the second question is “almost immediately”. 

Operating on the assumption that each retiring employee will need to be replaced by a new employee then the impact will be significant over the near term. Pewlett-Hackard is currently looking at losing almost a third of its workforce to retirement in the coming years, this “silver tsunami” would undoubtably be disruptive. How disruptive will depend on the company’s strategy moving forward, if it is able to increase productivity of its existing workforce, and if it can recruit and hire new employees to replace the retiring ones. There are a lot of reasons though to believe the impact will be negative and significant.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

In absolute terms, no. In practical terms, probably. We can use Senior Engineers as an example. There are currently 29,414 Senior Engineers eligible for retirement. This comprises 30.09% of the total of 97,750 Senior Engineers currently at Pewlett-Hackard. There are a total 12,283 Senior Engineers eligible for the mentorship program. This means there for 1 eligible Senior Engineer mentor for every 2.3 Senior Engineers eligible for retirement. If Pewlett-Hackard is able to spread out the number of Senior Engineer retirements over several years where the number of mentors to retiring Senior Engineers is kept below 1 to 2, then it is entirely feasible to say that there are enough qualified mentors to provide mentorship for the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. Additionally, some of the retirement eligible Senior Engineers could serve as mentors themselves, which could help smooth out the coming “silver tsunami”. The situation with the Senior Engineers is consistent with the other positions as well.
